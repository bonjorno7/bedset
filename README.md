### Bedset is a collection of tools to make Blender more comfortable

#### Pie menus
* Press B to open the Bedset pie, you can figure it out from there
* You can also navigate the menus easily with only the keyboard

#### Edges

* Select: select edges that meet the set criteria (seam, sharp, bevel, crease, angle)
* Select Inverted: select edges that meet the opposite criteria (not seam, not sharp, not bevel, not crease, not any)
* Mark: mark edges as seam, sharp, bevel, crease
* Clear: clear edges of seam, sharp, bevel, crease, all

I might add a menu for faces too, if I get some ideas of what to put there.

#### Booleans in object mode

* Difference
* Union
* Intersect
* Inset: makes an inset inside the cutter
* Extract: extracts the part of the target inside the cutter to a separate object

#### Booleans in edit mode

* Difference
* Union
* Intersect
* Cut: uses the cutter like a knife

#### Modifiers

* Apply: duplicate selected objects, apply all modifiers
* Bevel
* Solidify

Upcoming are Mirror, Array, Circular Array and maybe more.

#### Object

* Auto Smooth: smooth the selected objects and enable auto smooth with the specified angle
* Export OBJs: export each selected object to a .obj (you have to save the project first)
* Set Origin
* Apply Transforms

#### Baking

I added PBR baking a while ago but didn't end up using it. You can find the panel in the Bedset tab, in the list of tabs that appears when you press N in the 3D view.
